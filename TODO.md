- [ ] valgrind memtest
- [ ] generate docs from headers
- [ ] add unblocking select/poll support to fds (maybe in IO module?)
- [ ] (maybe?) set `fd_assignment` for a custom fd to -1 to prevent closing it in `sp_free`
- [ ] capturing return-code of programs terminating with signals (e.g. SIGSEGV) in `sp_wait`?
- [ ] move `process.c`-relevant header material into `process.h` and include it in `subproc.h`
