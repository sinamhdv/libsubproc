- [ ] valgrind memtest
- [X] fd leak test
- [ ] handle redirection of stderr to stdout (SPIO_STDOUT for fd_err only)
- [ ] (maybe?) add a SIGCHLD handler to automatically detect child terminations and set sp->is_alive to false there. (requires keeping a hash-table/list of all created subproc structs to be found by their pid so that we can set their is_alive to false).
- [ ] add docs for functions
- [ ] add SPIO_DEVNULL to fd modes
- [ ] add select/poll support to fds (maybe in IO module?)
